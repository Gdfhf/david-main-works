# david-main-works
## What is this?
**Repository where my works and projects outside of other repositories are stored for exhibition and recognition.**   
These projects can be media, documents or other miscelaneus projects as a form of resume.


## Projects in this respository
Currently, the works in this repository are:
- [`HTML_Documents`](HTML_Docments/Simple_Index.html): These HTML pages hold my analysis of the free available dataset from my Post Graduate program (See LinkedIn for more information). These pages were made from Jupyter Notebooks and computed using Google's Colab.
  - I won't upload the Jupyter files to prevent securities issues.
