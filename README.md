## What is this?
**Repository where my works and projects outside of other repositories are stored for exhibition and recognition.**   
These projects can be media, documents or other miscelaneus projects as a form of resume.


## Projects in this respository
Currently, the works in this repository are:
- **HTML documents from Jupyter notebooks**: These HTML pages hold my analysis of the free available dataset from my Post Graduate program.
  - I won't upload the Jupyter files to prevent securities issues.
